# Guidance, Navigation, and Control of an Autonomous X-wing Fighter
This project aims to verify if existing guidance, navigation, and control techniques can achieved a comparable simulation result to the science friction spaceship, star wars' x-wing fighter, introduced nearly 50 years ago. With lookahead-based line-of-sight guidance system, Kalman state estimation, along with proportion-derivative control, the simulated x-wing fighter can navigate and perform a surveillance mission; however, the control parameters are sensitive and have to be selected carefully.
