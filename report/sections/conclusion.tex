This project aims to verify if the existing guidance, navigation, and control techniques can achieved a comparable simulation result to the science friction spaceship, star wars' x-wing fighter, introduced nearly 50 years ago. 

The simulation results presented in this report supports that it is possible to control a sci-fi star wars' x-wing fighter using existing guidance, navigation, and control techniques. This work illustrates that lookahead-based line-of-sight guidance system, Kalman state estimation, along with proportion-derivative control can navigate a simulated x-wing fighter in a surveillance mission. Nevertheless, the control parameters have to be selected carefully. Too high value could cause oscillation and reduce the stability of the system, while inappropriate value could make the mission failed (i.e., being unable to reach the waypoint/target).

More advanced techniques could be utilized to improve the performance. For example, a feedforward control like model predictive control \cite{mpc_drone} could be employed to guarantee robust and optimal behavior. Parameter $\eta_e$ and $\eta_\Delta$ could be adapted online according to the distance between waypoints to improve path following and ensure success. Also, if the real-world measurement noise does not satisfy Gaussian distribution assumption, unscented Kalman filter or particle filter could be used as state estimation.
