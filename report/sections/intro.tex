Star wars is a multimedia science fiction franchise firstly introduced in 1977 \cite{starwars}. It involves a famous spaceship called "X-wing Fighter" as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(a). The spaceship consists of four winds forming X-shape, and it is able to take off vertically and battle in space. 

At that time, the real-world technology was still far from what mentioned in the science friction. As the time pass, people have developed new advanced technologies and advanced technique for controlling spacecrafts. Nowadays, we have seen many kind of robots, such as, autonomous mobile robot \cite{mir} that navigate throughout unseen space and autonomous quadrature drone \cite{mpc_drone,scimet_paper} with robust control strategy and advanced localization technique. These are the evidences that we are stepping closer to sci-fi movies. 

Therefore, this project aims to study and verify whether existing guidance, navigation, and control approaches is able to achieved what people in 1977 had imagined or not, and to which degree we are able to achieved it nowadays. In this works, the X-wing fighter is modeled as described in section~\ref{sec:model}. The guidance system is then discussed in section~\ref{sec:guidance}, following by the control described in  section~\ref{sec:control} and the state estimation described in  section~\ref{sec:statestimation}. The aforementioned process is then section~\ref{sec:experiment}, before the result is discussed and concluded in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
