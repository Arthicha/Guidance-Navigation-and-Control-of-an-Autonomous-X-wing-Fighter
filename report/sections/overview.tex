The control system of the autonomous x-wing fighter is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}. Overall, after a state estimator (Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(h–i)) estimates the x-wing fighter's pose, a guidance system (Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(g)) produces desired velocities, telling the direction toward waypoints. A controller (Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(e–f)) then stabilizes and produces actuator commands sending to the x-wing fighter model (Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(b–d)) to stabilize and move the fighter accordingly. Finally, the x-wing fighter is visualized in a simulation (Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}(a)). The github repository of this project is available at \textcolor{red}{xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx}.
